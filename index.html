                    <h2>NA'IM SAMSOR</h2>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Mohamad Naim bin Samsor. I live in Terengganu. I was born in 9 September 1998. I am a fresh graduate and finished my degree in Computer Engineering at Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP). I am taking this course because I love to play and learn about computer. I also have a passion to code and designing website. I have always been fascinated by the programming the code and designing the website and have taken actual steps toward my dream of becoming a Software or Computer Engineer. As computer Engineer can revise and improve software, like coding for the computer system. I can work well together as a team and work with other engineers to combine thoughts and ideas. I am a thoughtful person. I always pay attention to details and can percieve people.s needs before they ask for help.
                    So far I've been doing my intership at LIEOS Technologhy SDN BHD as computer technician for 6 months. At there, I was testing the computer system and work on computers that need to be fixed with hardware and software issues. Other things that they do are as follows like diagnose and troubleshoot failed rotational media and solid state storage devices. Then also analyze user needs and recommend appropriate hardware. For the project i have done when study for the Group Design Project is IoT-Based Environment Controlled System using Arduino. Creating a sensor controller system in class based on environment like when raining the sensor will detect it and door and window will shut automatically. Then, for the final year project is Food Order Online System Using Android App. Creating an order application system like Food Panda. I would very much like to join your ranks and learn from your expertise as I upgrade my own performance.Thank you
